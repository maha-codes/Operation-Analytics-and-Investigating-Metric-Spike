Operation Analytics is the analysis done for the complete end to end operations of a company. With the help of this, the company then finds the areas on which it must improve upon. You work closely with the ops team, support team, marketing team, etc and help them derive insights out of the data they collect.
Investigating metric spike is also an important part of operation analytics. Data Analysts must be able to answer questions like- Why is there a dip in daily engagement? Why have sales taken a dip? etc. Questions like these must be answered daily and for that its very important to investigate metric spike.
